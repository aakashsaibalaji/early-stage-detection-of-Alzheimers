Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned few Machine and Deep Learning models (ANN,RC-NN,Kmediods,BiLSTM),in which RC got 85%, 
As an extension we have applied SVM,RF,DT, Voting Classifier and CNN + LSTM, in which Voting Classifier and Random Forest got 87% and 88% 
So with the Random Forest Classifier we build the model used for predicting the result.
